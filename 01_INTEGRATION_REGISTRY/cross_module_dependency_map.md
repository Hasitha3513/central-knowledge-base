# Cross-Module Dependency Map

## Directional Integration Map

| Consumer | Provider | Needed information | Approved mechanism | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Finance | Transportation | completed trips, freight charges, fuel/maintenance costs | Events; query API for reconciliation | PROPOSED |
| Transportation | Finance | payment/credit approval, cost posting result | Events; focused API | PROPOSED |
| Transportation | HRM | driver identity, qualification, availability | API/port plus change events | PROPOSED; current driver data is local legacy |
| Maintenance | Transportation | vehicle identity, meter readings, availability | Events and vehicle query API | PROPOSED |
| Transportation | Maintenance | maintenance hold/release and forecast | Events and availability API | PROPOSED; current schedules are local legacy |
| Maintenance | Inventory | parts availability, reservations, issues | API/port and stock events | PROPOSED |
| Procurement | Inventory | replenishment demand and receipt | Events/API | PROPOSED |
| Procurement | Finance | budget and payment controls | API/events | PROPOSED |
| Projects | HRM | staffing and time facts | Events/API | PROPOSED |
| Projects | Finance | budgets and actual costs | Events/API | PROPOSED |
| Sales/CRM | Inventory | available-to-promise | API | PROPOSED |
| Sales/CRM | Transportation | shipment plan and delivery status | Commands/API and events | PROPOSED |
| Delivery (Transportation internal) | Freight, Trip, Organization, Notification, Offline Sync | freight-order facts, trip facts, customer/location references, delivery notifications, offline acknowledgements | Delivery-owned provider-neutral ports only; no direct repositories/JPA/tables | FOUNDATION_ONLY |

## Ownership Decisions

- Transportation owns trips, routes, freight execution, operational vehicle readings, and transport-specific fuel facts.
- Transportation now contains a dedicated Delivery Modulith boundary for MVP 1.3 foundation contracts; Delivery story workflows and persistence remain pending.
- HRM will own employee master and employment lifecycle; migration/bridging of the current `driver` model requires an ADR.
- Vehicle Maintenance will own maintenance work execution; migration/bridging of current `maintenance_schedule` requires an ADR.
- Finance owns ledgers, invoices, payments, tax accounting, and financial posting—not operational source facts.
- Inventory owns stock balances and movements; Procurement owns purchasing intent and purchase-order lifecycle.
- Sales/CRM owns prospects, customer relationships, quotations, and sales orders. Customer-master ownership requires an ADR because transportation currently owns a `customer` table/API.
- Project Management owns projects, work structures, milestones, and project budgets. Current transportation `project` references are legacy and require ownership reconciliation.

## Forbidden Edges

No module may use another module's SQL, JPA repository, entity, table-level join, or physical foreign key. IDs crossing boundaries are UUID logical references. A read model may combine events in its own schema but must not query producer tables.

## Integration Review Checklist

Confirm ownership, tenant propagation, data classification, contract version, source of truth, consistency expectation, idempotency, ordering, retry/dead-letter behavior, authorization, observability, retention, and producer/consumer contract tests.
